/*
 
GoEngine is a chess engine written purely in golang. This engine is
written as part of a larger project, GoChess: a fully fleged chess
application. GoEngine intends on featuring deep-learning evaluation
and classical chess-programming techniques to make it similar modern
engines, while still being simple enough to learn about how chess
engines operate.
